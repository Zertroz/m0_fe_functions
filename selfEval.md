# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area? Definitely an area I'm working on. I don't have any tips as much as I would appreciate tips from others. That being said, I think my current method is somewhat working for me.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is? Functions are the directions that a program follows.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters. Arguments add data to a function call, while a parameter works within the function to add variables.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group? None I can think of.
